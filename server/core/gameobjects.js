// i believe i will go the unity route and make gameobject mostly an empty object that can have components added, removed, and deactivated etc from it. i thought about making factories or constructor functions etc that composite objects together but the problem with that is they cant be uncomposited after creation, they just are what they are after that. but with this i can remove or deactivate an added component at any time. i dont have to actually merge it all together.
